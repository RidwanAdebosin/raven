City officials confirmed on Tuesday that the riverside park will reopen this summer after a two-year renovation.
Crews installed 175 energy-efficient lights, replanted native wildflowers, and added a playground designed by local artists.
The project ran $1.8 million under budget, according to Deputy Mayor Alicia Gómez — a welcome surprise for residents concerned about rising taxes.
"It's not just a facelift; it's a commitment to public space," said Gomez. Cyclists tested the new bike lanes, while children chased bubbles during the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
The park will host weekly night markets featuring Afghan bolani, Jamaican patties, and vegan empanadas, with vendors selected through a community ballot.
Public transit advocates noted that the expanded bus schedule, combined with real-time arrival boards, should alleviate weekend congestion.
Sustainability officers also unveiled a solar-powered irrigation system and a pollinator habitat that includes milkweed, lavender, and rare prairie clover.
Early visitor surveys show 92% satisfaction, with many praising the accessible design, tactile maps, and multilingual audio tours available in English, Spanish, Mandarin, and American Sign Language.
The city plans to share open-source blueprints and a detailed maintenance playbook with other municipalities considering similar upgrades.
