(** Pre-tokenization for text processing pipelines.

    Pre-tokenizers are the first stage in text tokenization pipelines. They
    split raw text into smaller pieces before vocabulary-based tokenization
    (like BPE or WordPiece) is applied. This splitting is crucial for handling
    different languages, punctuation, and special formatting.

    {1 Overview}

    Pre-tokenization serves several purposes:
    - Language-aware splitting (whitespace varies by language)
    - Punctuation handling (separate or merge with adjacent text)
    - Character encoding normalization (Unicode, byte-level representations)
    - Format preservation (maintaining character offsets for downstream tasks)

    The pre-tokenization process takes raw text and returns a list of (piece,
    (start, end)) tuples, where each piece is a substring and the offsets
    indicate its position in the original text.

    {1 Common Patterns}

    Most tokenizers follow this pattern:
    + {b Normalization}: Convert text to canonical form (lowercase, accent
      removal)
    + {b Pre-tokenization}: Split into words/subwords using this module
    + {b Tokenization}: Apply vocabulary-based encoding (BPE, WordPiece, etc.)
    + {b Post-processing}: Add special tokens, create attention masks

    {1 Usage Examples}

    Basic word-level splitting:
    {[
      let pre_tokenizer = Pre_tokenizers.whitespace in
      let pieces = pre_tokenizer "Hello world! How are you?" in
      (* Result: [("Hello", (0, 5)); ("world!", (6, 12)); ("How", (13, 16));
                   ("are", (17, 20)); ("you?", (21, 25))] *)
    ]}

    Byte-level processing for robust handling:
    {[
      let pre_tokenizer = Pre_tokenizers.byte_level ~add_prefix_space:true ~use_regex:true () in
      let pieces = pre_tokenizer "Hello 🤖 world!" in
      (* Handles Unicode robustly, converts to byte representation *)
    ]}

    Chaining multiple pre-tokenizers:
    {[
      let chain = Pre_tokenizers.sequence [
        Pre_tokenizers.punctuation ~behavior:`Isolated ();
        Pre_tokenizers.whitespace;
        Pre_tokenizers.digits ~individual_digits:false ();
      ] in
      let pieces = chain "Hello, world! The year is 2024." in
      (* Applies punctuation splitting, then whitespace, then digit handling *)
    ]}

    {1 Character Offset Preservation}

    All pre-tokenizers maintain character offsets, crucial for:
    - Highlighting tokens in original text
    - Named entity recognition alignment
    - Question answering span extraction
    - Error reporting and debugging

    {[
      let text = "The quick brown fox jumps" in
      let pieces = Pre_tokenizers.whitespace text in
      List.iter
        (fun (piece, (start, end_)) ->
          Printf.printf "'%s' at positions %d-%d: '%s'\n" piece start end_
            (String.sub text start (end_ - start)))
        pieces
      (* Verifies that substrings match original text positions *)
    ]}

    {1 Language-Specific Considerations}

    Different pre-tokenizers handle various languages:
    - {!whitespace}: Good for space-separated languages (English, Spanish)
    - {!bert}: Handles CJK characters and punctuation (Chinese, Japanese,
      Korean)
    - {!byte_level}: Universal but loses some linguistic structure
    - {!unicode_scripts}: Script-aware splitting for multilingual text

    {1 Performance Notes}

    Pre-tokenization can be a bottleneck in tokenization pipelines:
    - Simple splitters like {!whitespace_split} are fastest
    - Regex-based splitters like {!byte_level} with use_regex are slower but
      more accurate
    - {!sequence} applies all pre-tokenizers, increasing cost linearly
    - Consider caching results for repeated text processing *)

type t = string -> (string * (int * int)) list
(** Pre-tokenizer function type.

    Takes a string and returns a list of (piece, (start_offset, end_offset))
    tuples. Each piece is a substring of the input, and the offsets indicate its
    position in the original text. Offsets are character-based (not byte-based).

    Invariants:
    - Pieces, when concatenated, should reconstruct the original text (possibly
      with some normalization)
    - Offsets must be valid: 0 <= start_offset < end_offset <= String.length
      text
    - Offsets must be non-overlapping and in ascending order *)

val bert : unit -> t
(** [bert text] applies BERT-style pre-tokenization.

    Splits on whitespace and separates punctuation. Designed for BERT-family
    models. Handles CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters by treating each
    as a separate token.

    Behavior:
    - Whitespace separated into tokens
    - Punctuation characters isolated (each punct char becomes separate token)
    - CJK characters split individually
    - Preserves case and accents

    {[
      let pieces = Pre_tokenizers.bert "Hello, world! 你好" in
      (* Result approximately:
         [("Hello", (0, 5)); (",", (5, 6)); (" ", (6, 7)); ("world", (7, 12));

(** [byte_level ?add_prefix_space ?use_regex ()] creates a byte-level
    pre-tokenizer.

    Used by GPT-2 style models. Converts text to byte representation and applies
    regex-based splitting. Handles any Unicode text robustly by treating
    everything as byte sequences.

    @param add_prefix_space
      If true, adds a space at the beginning if text doesn't start with
      whitespace. Default: false.
    @param use_regex
      If true, uses GPT-2's regex pattern for splitting. If false, uses simpler
      splitting. Default: true.

    The GPT-2 regex pattern handles:
    - Apostrophe contractions ("don't", "I'm")
    - Letter sequences
    - Number sequences
    - Whitespace sequences
    - Individual characters as fallback

val whitespace : unit -> t
(** [whitespace text] splits on whitespace using pattern \\w+|[^\\w\\s]+.

    Groups word characters (letters, digits, underscore) together and groups

(** Delimiter handling behavior for splitting operations.

    Controls what happens to delimiter characters when splitting text:

    - [`Isolated]: Delimiter becomes its own token (e.g., "hello,world" →
      ["hello"; ","; "world"])
    - [`Removed]: Delimiter is discarded (e.g., "hello,world" →
      ["hello"; "world"])
    - [`Merged_with_previous]: Delimiter attached to preceding token (e.g.,
      "hello,world" → ["hello,"; "world"])
    - [`Merged_with_next]: Delimiter attached to following token (e.g.,
      "hello,world" → ["hello"; ",world"])
    - [`Contiguous]: Multiple consecutive delimiters grouped together (e.g.,
