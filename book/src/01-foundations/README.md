# Part I · Foundations

Part I establishes the mindset and tooling required to build modern machine learning systems in OCaml.

1. We introduce Raven’s philosophy and how its components map to the Python-dominated ML stack.
2. We give an OCaml refresher tailored to ML engineers, focusing on the language features that power Raven’s APIs.
3. We assemble a productive workflow—dune, opam, mdx, Quill notebooks, and VS Code integrations—that we will reuse throughout the book.

Once you are comfortable with these foundations, we will move into differentiable programming with Nx and Rune.
